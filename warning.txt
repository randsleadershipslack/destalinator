Hey very quiet channel. We tend the channel garden by archiving channels that have been quiet for 30 straight days and this channel is one of them. Archiving a channel removes it from the list of active channels and prevents new comments from being made there. That makes it easier for newer folks to find the right place to get their questions, answers and comments heard without wading through extraneous channels or worse, posting a comment only to hear nothing in response. All existing comments in the channel are retained for easy browsing and searching and can be read like any other channel. If need for this particular channel arises again, it can be unarchived by any user here. If you'd like to keep this channel active, SAY ANYTHING and we'll reset the timer. It's that simple. If we don't hear from anyone in the next 30 days, this channel will be archived.
